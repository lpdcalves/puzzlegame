# Bob & Joe: an indie pixelart puzzle platformer made with Unity

I started making this game with a few friends in 2016. The project was abandoned without any major progress, and left alone for more than a year. In late 2017 I revived it for a programming assignment in a college class, and over a couple of months managed to create a short but functional indie puzzle game. It is a local co-op puzzle platformer, and requires both players to work together in order to solve the puzzles.
